Code Challenge for I See Me
Thank you for participating in our code challenge. We are looking to see a test in 
your HTML, design, CSS, and javascript skills. Please host all resources required 
for the challenge in your GitHub with instructions. The rules are as follows:

1) Take the current iseeme.com home page and, using the HTML on the page, 
redesign and style it. Do as much or as little as you would like, as long as the 
name of the company and the logo does not change. There are no other 
requirements.

2) Take any additional page from the iseeme.com site and repeat the steps 
from #1. Style however you like, as long as the logo and name of the 
company do not change.

3) BONUS: Take any 3rd page from the iseeme.com site (or the home page 
itself). Ignoring UX and styling, remake the page using some framework such 
as Angular, React, Vue.js, etc. You can choose to also style the page if you 
would like, but the point here is to try experimenting with a new technology.
Make sure all changes and any instructions to display them are in your GitHub 
and a link to the repository is posted and sent back to us.
